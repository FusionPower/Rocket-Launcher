# Rocket-Launcher

This is a tool that simulates rocket launches from the surface of the Earth given an initial velocity and an angle.

The simulation will test all combinations of pairs of velocities (to be specified) and angles (to be specified). This simulation only takes into account gravitational pull and ignores air resistance. Also, the only two particles given are the Earth and the rocket.

To edit velocity:
- Go to the end of the code and edit the for loop in line 215

To edit angle:
- Go to the end of the code and edit the for loop in line 216


GOOD LUCK, ASTRONAUT!
